fiddleware-styles
=================

This repo contains the basic styles for all fiddleware applications. The styles require the use of Stylus and Nib, and are built with Meteor in mind. If using within a different context (say, Express) you may need to package them slightly differently. 

The styles are built off of Bootstrap.
